## Notes about points to make

- A Series must be appended in the _series_ Chart array configuration.
Most of the series ref pages mention this but I don't see it in any of the examples
or maybe I don't know what I'm looking at...
- Minumum/maximum values cause values to be bound.  If no values are set,
then the scale auto-adjusts to the values.
You can set just the minimum value to 0
to ensure that the grid starts at 0
even if all Series have values greater than 0.
- Talk about renderers
- Talk about mouseup, mousedown, etc.  These are Listeners,
described on Ext.chart.series.Series page
- Setting axis: [`left`,`bottom`] for each series config might be necessary
for Time axis.  From comment in Ext.chart.axis.Time -- guy had Time axis on
bottom, Numeric axis on the left, line series.
- Discuss groupBy and aggregateOp configs.
From comment to Ext.chart.axis.Time.
- Passing Series instances instead of config objects is supported
- or rather, was until 4.1.2 - and so this regression got to be fixed.
(from hipchat discussion 4/9 on Ext JS)
- Talk about animation with different Series
- Explain why scatter does not disappear and reappear similar to line
(comment to Ext.chart.series.Scatter)
- How to do a "trend line" for scatter plots
(comment to Ext.chart.series.Scatter)
- Time axes vs. using timestamps on a Category axis.
- Explain Sprites; they allow you to customize the Charts
through the "renderer" functions
(hooks in the drawing code that allow the apps to override the default behavior).
