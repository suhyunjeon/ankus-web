This parameter allows you to specify precisely which class members (fields & methods) should be documented.
<p>
The tags specified in this parameter are treated as follows.
<p>
A class <b>member</b> is included in the documentation only when it has one of the specified tags.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When the class containing such a member must be excluded,
the member itself may still appear in the documentation.
If that class has subclasses to be documented, the member will be shown as if it belongs
to those of them, which are the nearest descendants of the member's original class.

<table border="1" style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
<tr><td><font face="Dialog" size="-1">
When you specify this parameter, the condition above is only necessary for a member
to be actually included in the documentation scope. Using other <i>include/exclude</i> parameters,
you can limit which members are included even further!
</font>
</td></tr>
</table>

The multiple exclude-tag names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<dl><dd><code>
  @api<br>
  @include
</code></dd></dl>
