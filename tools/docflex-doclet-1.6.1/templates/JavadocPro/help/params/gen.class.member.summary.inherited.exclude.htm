This parameter allows you to exclude the lists of inner classes, fields or methods
that are inherited from the classes/interfaces which belong to the specified packages.
<p>
For instance, you may want to suppress the long lists of the class members inherited from standard Java API classes
and, thereby, to reduce the output documentation
<p>
The packages, whose classes/interfaces should not appear in the <i>"inherited from ..."</i> lists, 
are specified as the list of package patterns separated with newlines or colons (<code>:</code>).
For example:

<dl><dd><code>
java.lang.*<br>
javax.swing.*
</code></dd></dl>
