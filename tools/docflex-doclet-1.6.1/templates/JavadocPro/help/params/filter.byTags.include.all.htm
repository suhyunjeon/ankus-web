Specify tags, by which both classes and class members (i.e. fields, constructors and methods)
are included in the generated documentation.
<p>
When this parameter is specified, the entire documentation scope will be limited as follows.
<p>
A <b>class</b> is included in the documentation only when at least one of the conditions is met:
<ol>
  <li>The class has one of the specified tags.</li>
  <li>This is an inner class and one of its enclosing classes has one of the specified tags.</li>
</ol>
A class <b>member</b> is included according to one of the conditions:
<ol>
<li>
  The member has one of the specified tags.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  <b>Note:</b> When the class containing the member must be excluded,
  the member itself may still appear in the documentation.
  If that class has documented subclasses, the member will be shown as if it belongs
  to those of them, which are the nearest descendants of the member's original class.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
  The member's class has one of the specified tags.
</li>
<li>
  The member's class is an inner class and one of its enclosing classes has one of the specified tags.
</li>
</ol>

<table border="1" style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt">

When you specify this parameter, the criteria above are only necessary for a class or member to be actually
included in the documentation scope. However, they do not guarantee it.
Using other <i>include/exclude</i> parameters, you can limit the documentation scope even further!

</td></tr>
</table>

The multiple exclude-tag names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<dl><dd>
<code>
@api<br>
@include
</code>
</dd></dl>
