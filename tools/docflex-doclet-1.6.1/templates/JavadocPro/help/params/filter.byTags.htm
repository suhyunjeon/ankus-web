This group of parameters allows you to filter classes and members by tags.
You can identify classes and members to be documented both:
<ul>
<li>Explicitly -- those that are marked with <i>including tags</i></li>
<li>Implicitly -- those that are not marked with the <i>excluding tags</i></li>
</ul>

<table border="1" style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
<tr><td style="font-family: Dialog; font-size:12pt">
Note that since any tags are embedded in Java doc comments,
they are not stored in the compiled Java code.
So, you can filter by tags only classes and members whose Java sources 
have been specified on the Javadoc command line (with
<code>-<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#sourcepath">sourcepath</a></code>
option or directly).
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
If you need to filter anything contained in the compiled object code,
use filtering by annotations instead (see 
<i>"Filter Classes & Members | By Annotations"</i> parameter group)
</td></tr>
