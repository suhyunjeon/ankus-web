This parameter allows you to specify precisely which class members (fields & methods) should be documented.
<p>
The annotation types specified in this parameter are treated as follows.
<p>
A class <b>member</b> is included in the documentation only
when it has an annotation of one of the specified types.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When the class containing such a member must be excluded,
the member itself may still appear in the documentation.
If that class has subclasses to be documented, the member will be shown as if it belongs
to those of them, which are the nearest descendants of the member's original class.

<tr><td><font face="Dialog" size="-1">
When you specify this parameter, the condition above is only necessary for a member
to be actually included in the documentation scope. Using other <i>include/exclude</i> parameters,
you can limit which members are included even further!

Each annotation type must be specified with its <b>fully qualified name</b> (e.g. <code>java.lang.Deprecated</code>).
Multiple annotation type names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<dl><dd>
<code>
  my.core.util.Public<br>
  my.project.api.Include
</code>
</dd></dl>
