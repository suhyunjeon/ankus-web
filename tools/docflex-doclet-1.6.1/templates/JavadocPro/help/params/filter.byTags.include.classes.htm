With this parameter you can explicitly identify classes to be documented,
while keeping in the documentation some of the fields and methods defined in the classes to be excluded.
<p>
The tags specified in this parameter are treated as follows.
<p>
A <b>class</b> is included in the documentation only when it has one of the specified tags.
<p>
Each <b>inheritable member</b> of any excluded class, which has subclasses to be documented,
will be shown as if it belongs to those of them that are the nearest descendants of the member's original class.

<table border="1" style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
<tr><td><font face="Dialog" size="-1">
When you specify this parameter, the criteria above are only necessary for a class or member to be actually
included in the documentation scope. However, they do not guarantee it.
Using other <i>include/exclude</i> parameters, you can limit the documentation scope even further!

</td></tr>
</table>

The multiple exclude-tag names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<dl><dd><code>
  @api<br>
  @include
</code></dd></dl>
