Do not document packages that contain no classes or interfaces included in the documentation scope.
<p>
Normally, Javadoc does not document empty paclages.
But when filtering by tags/annotations is applied, some of the packages may become effectively empty.
Yet, they will be still visible in the documentation.
This parameter allows you to suppress documenting such packages.
