Specify annotation types by which only class members (i.e. fields, constructors and methods) are selectively excluded from the generated documentation.
<p>
A class member, which otherwise (without this parameter) would be documented, is excluded when it has an annotation of one of the specified types.
<p>
Each annotation type must be specified with its <b>fully qualified name</b> (e.g. <code>java.lang.Deprecated</code>). Multiple annotation type names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
my.core.util.Internal
my.project.api.Exclude
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
