Allows to suppress generation of lists of the inner classes, fields or methods inherited from those classes/interfaces, which belong to the packages specified with this parameter.
<p>
This parameter may be especially useful to suppress long lists of  the class members inherited from the standard Java API classes and, in such a way, to considerably reduce the output documentation.
<p>
The packages, whose classes/inerfaces should not appear
in the "inherited from ..." lists, are specified as the list of the package name prefixes delimited with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (;) or colons (:).
<p>
For example, the following will exclude lists of the members inherited from most of the standard Java API classes:
<blockquote><pre><code>
java.lang.
javax.swing.
</code></pre></blockquote>
