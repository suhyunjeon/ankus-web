Specify the packages whose qualifying names should be omitted
from ahead of class names in parameters, types, referenced classes (like exception lists, implemented interfaces, etc.),
@see tags and {@link} tags in comments.
<p>
The packages to omit are specified as the list of package name prefixes delimited with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (;) or colons (:).
For example:
<blockquote><pre><code>
java.lang.
javax.swing.
</code></pre></blockquote>
When a particular fully-qualified name is decided whether
to be shortened, the answer will be yes when the full name
starts with one of the specified prefixes.
